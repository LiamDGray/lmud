# Change Log

## Version 0.4

### Command Parsing

Support the following world-creation commands:

* [x] aesir-level
  * [x] open ``<dir> <name>``
  * [x] dig ``<dir> <name>``

Support the following permissions-related commands:

* [x] add a god-level permission for granting god permissions in-game
* [x] add a wizard-level permission for granting wizard permissions in-game
* [x] split up wizard commands and regular commands


Support the following usage workflow:

1. [x] Enter a command in the MUD
1. [x] The command is checked against a list of aliases
1. [x] If matched, the actual command is used instead of the alias
1. [x] Command and args are parsed
1. [x] Appropriate mod:func + args is called
1. [x] Results of call are printed to terminal session


Support the following development workflow:

* [x] Base commands as well as aliases have metadata for which group of
      commands they belong to (useful for printing help and extended help
      for commands)
* [x] A base module exists which has a list of all supported commands +
      help text + mod:func they dispatch to
* [x] A new module is created with a list of aliases + actual command names
* [x] A data amalgamation function is updated to include calling the data
      function of the new module, adding its aliases/commands to the list of
      command data
* [x] A parsing function pulls in the base commands as well as all the
      defined aliases in the alias modules and the aliases are mapped to
      actual mod:func
* [x] parse_cmd checks the passed command (from user input) against this data
      structure to see if alias, if base command, which mod:func to call


Support the following command-related commands:

* [x] help (and aliases) - display base commands only
* [x] help aliases - display all aliases, grouped by type (e.g., IRC, WoW,
      etc.)
* [x] help commands - display aliases as well as base commands

### Breakout and Dependencies

* [x] move mud_parser into its own repo/project
  * add as a dependency
* [x] add erlang color as a dep:
  * https://github.com/julianduque/erlang-color
  * [x] replace custom color macros
* [x] Move lib/erlymud into top-level dir


### Colorizing

Update outputs with the following colors:

* [x] whisper -> magenta
* [x] say -> yellow
* [x] emote -> yellow (bold)
* [x] leave & arrive messages -> yellow (bold)
* [x] think -> black (bold); really grey
* [x] room title -> green (bold)


### Game Data

Game data is currently written to files; we should moved to a database
instead. Before doing that, though, it might be nice to put all data
read/write functions in a common module:

* [x] create a new filestore module
* [x] update "living" code to use it
* [x] update login code to use it
* [x] update object code to use it
* [x] update room code to use it
* [x] update user code to use it


### Talking

* [x] Add support for EMIT/MSG


### Migration to LFE

* [x] include LFE as a dep
* [x] all new functionality, write in LFE
  * [x] port newly-added em_util to lmud-util
* [x] rename to lmud or Î»MUD
* continue to use em_* Erlang modules (as legacy)
  * slowly port these to LFE, as time and interest allows

### User Experience

* [x] Add readline support (done via rlwrap)
* [x] use this ASCII:
   ```

## 0.3.2

* Incorporated Steve Vinoski's SHA2 module (as em_util_sha2.erl) to avoid

  right now except decline any option requests; implemented according to
  the Q Method <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1143.html>

  buffering until we encounter \r\n
* Documented what a successful login sequence looks like, see the file
  doc/LoginSequence.html (which renders using websequencediagrams.com)

## 0.3.1

* Initial 'public' release

  IAC WILL/WONT ECHO

    be restarted, as you can do this with this command without having to
    logout.

Chat Commands Edit

These commands are used to say things to other players. Unless otherwise
noted, these channels are displayed in your current language. So, for
example, if a Night Elf is currently speaking in Darnassian, Human players
would not be able to understand them.

/e, /em, /emote, /me <message>
    Emotes <message> to all players in the general area, similar to /say,
    except displayed as "Player <message>". So, for example, "/emote loves
    the WOW Wiki." would be displayed as "Player loves the WOW Wiki." Unlike
    other chat commands, this one does not use your current language. Across
    faction boundaries it simply displays "Player makes some strange
    gestures."

/bg <message>
    Displays <message> to all other raid members while in a PvP battleground.

/c, /csay <channel> <message>
    Sends <message> to all players in <channel>. This does not use your
    current language. You can also use /# (where # is the channel number) to
    send a message to <channel>.

/g, /gc, /gu, /guild <message>
    Displays <message> to all members in your guild.

/o, /osay <message>
    Displays <message> to all officers in your guild. (You must have the
    'Officer Chat Speak' privilege to use this)

/p, /party <message>
    Displays <message> to all other party members. This does not include
    other people in your raid group, use /raid for that.

/r, /reply <message>
    Replies to the last player to send you a /whisper

/ra, /raid, /rsay <message>
    Displays <message> to all other raid members. While in a PvP
    battleground, use /bg instead.

/s, /say <message>
    Displays <message> to other players in the general area.

/send, /t, /tell, /w, /whisper <player> <message>
    Sends the private message <message> to <player>. No other players will
    see the message.

/sh, /shout, /y, /yell <message>
    Displays <message> to other players in the area. The area of players
    that will see the message is larger than the area when /say is used.

/v <macro>
    Plays the sound associated with the given voice macro <macro>.

Online Status Edit

/afk [message]
    Toggles Away From Keyboard status. <AFK> status appears next to your
    name. This command also forces an immediate exit from any PvP
    battleground. If you enter a message, players sending you a /whisper
    will be sent this message in addition to the standard <AFK> message.

/dnd [message]
    Toggles Do Not Disturb status. When DND is set, you cannot receive /
    whisper messages. A player attempting to send a /whisper will be
    notified that you have Do Not Disturb set. If you specify a message,
    they will also be sent that message.

/friend, /friends [player]
    Adds [player] or your current target to your friends list. If nothing is
    targeted, your friend list will be displayed. See /remfriend.

/ignore [player]

    to undo this.

/remfriend, /removefriend [player]
    Removes [player] or your current target from your friends list. See /

# λMUD

λMUD (pronounded "L-MUD" or "El-MUD") is a rather minimalistic MUD server,
written in Erlang and LFE, making use of the excellent OTP libraries.

The aim is to have solid support for exploration, roleplaying, and in-game
economies deployed on a highly fault-tolerant environment (which supports
hot-code loads) where system crashes or reboots are more of an exotic
curiosity than a commonplace thing.

## Milestones

* Current: [0.7.x](https://github.com/lfex/lmud/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A0.7.0+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* All: [Open](https://github.com/lfex/lmud/milestones?direction=desc&sort=count&state=open)

## Background

Erlang/OTP is an excellent match for MUD development, with strong support
for concurrency through light-weight processes, hot code upgrades, near-
transparent mechanisms for distributed computing, etc.

This project has dual ancestry: originally based on the
[ErlyMUD](https://bitbucket.org/jwarlander/erlymud) code, it
derives much of its new MUDness from
[TinyMUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TinyMUD) servers like
[TinyMUSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TinyMUSH),
[PennMUSH](http://www.pennmush.org/),
etc.

## Run Immediately

If you just want to check out the lmud server, you can do so with the following:

  ```sh
  $ make docker-run
  ```

Note: The docker image lfex/lmud is for armv8.  If your host system isn't that, you may need to use QEMU. E.g. on Ubuntu on amd64:

sudo apt-get install qemu qemu-system-arm qemu-efi

This will use the published docker image with a game-data volume.

## Building & Running

  1. Download the latest:

     ```sh
     $ git clone https://github.com/lfex/lmud.git
     ```

  1. Change directory, compile the source, and make a release:

     ```sh
     $ cd lmud
     $ make
     ```

     Note that this requires having the following installed:
     * GNU make
     * Erlang
     * rebar3

  1. Start up λMUD:
     
     ```sh
     $ make start
     ```
     
     Additionally, you can start the MUD with the LFE REPL (useful if you're
     going to be developing or debugging):
     
     ```sh
     $ rebar3 lfe repl
     ```

## Connecting a Client

  1. From another terminal, connect to the game:

     ```sh
     $ make connect
     ```

     This `make` target uses the `rlwrap` CLI tool, which provides readline
     support in telnet. That, in turn, allows you to use a command history like
     with your system shell (including such things as searching the command
     history with `^r`).

     Once connected, you should see something like this:

     ```
     Trying 127.0.0.1...
     Connected to localhost.
     Escape character is '^]'.
